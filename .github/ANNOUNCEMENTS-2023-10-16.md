## svelte-video-kit Team Update
October 16, 2023

ðŸ‘‹ We're thrilled to breathe new life into this project.

We aspire for the project to have a fresh start and become even more amazing.

## What is svelte-video-kit?
svelte-video-kit is a library that provides a customizable video component for use in your Svelte applications.

[svelte-video-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-video-player) was initially implemented in 2021 by  [Meigo-Kukk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meigo-kukk/) (He's not available for support) and has since evolved the repository.

## Is it called [svelte-video-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-video-player) or svelte-video-kit?
Due to the existing repository being already published as a package on the NPM website under [svelte-video-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-video-player), we have decided to use the name svelte-video-kit.

## Is this the official library?
Currently, we are referring to it as the official library to eliminate ambiguity among various rewritten and forked versions that are not community-maintained. We have merged all active forks up to this point. We will remove the "official" term when the library is more stable and there is less chaos in its community.

## I heard something happened. What's the TLDR?
The [svelte-video-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-video-player) project was led by  [Meigo-Kukk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meigo-kukk/), a passionate and influential figure in the Node world. However, he disappeared, and the last update to the repository was on August 5, 2021, leading to the package's stagnation and the abandonment of the project.

Now, we are transforming [svelte-video-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svelte-video-player) into a community-driven project, with the involvement of more engineers from diverse backgrounds.

## In conclusion...
We are excited to breathe new life into this idea and project.

This project is on the verge of reinventing itself and promises to be even more impressive.

In light of the attention it has received from both the media and the community, we felt the need to make a public announcement.

We are confident that we have made decisions that will benefit our community the most.

We will not only continue to nurture this project but actively work on developing new and amazing features.

With gratitude,
[Ediberto B.O](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edibertooliveira/) and the svelte-video-kit team
